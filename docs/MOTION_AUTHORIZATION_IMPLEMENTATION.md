# Motion authorization implementation and acceptance (#924)

This is a safety-critical, partial implementation of #924. It verifies FTC's
intended commands and bounds EscapeStartBlocked. It does not establish the
stack-wide autonomous-motion invariant or physical containment.

## Baselines and checkpoint

- Branch: `feat/924-motion-authorization`, isolated worktree `.motion-924`.
- Draft PR: [#950](https://github.com/mowglinext/mowglinext/pull/950), against
  `dev`; no merge, ready-for-review transition or physical deployment performed.
- Base: `dev` `9f39497f26f4759a0b26e601904710fb934beb65`.
- Original #942 regression source: `ddd49d9f59e202c265d5aca5e0d1154b79a721af`.
  Its branch and Draft PR were not modified. The original assertions and
  scenarios were retained; additional tests and real map-publication fixtures
  supply the geometry required by the production interface.
- Production checkpoint: `26926295`. Final-source native checks passed:
  navigation 22/22, behavior 46/46 and map 12/12 CTest targets. Later changes
  record test latency and update documentation; motion production is unchanged.
  Packaging checkpoint `0f66cd8c` adds Boost headers and visualization_msgs to
  the five thin sensor build dependency lists after CI exposed missing Boost.
- #905 (`26a2515d`) and #906 (`a04c4219`) were open and unmerged when inspected.
  This imports #905-compatible raw MarkerArray publication and segment logic,
  not its transit planner or another geometry grid. Coordinate the overlapping
  publisher changes before either branch merges.

## Authorization policy

The reference point is the rear axle, `base_footprint`; `base_link` has the same
XY origin. FTC coverage commands keep that point in the recorded mowing union.
Blade-off Escape may use the recorded mowing, navigation and dock-corridor
union. A navigation corridor cannot grant FTC coverage permission. Body
extension beyond an outer boundary remains permitted by the axle policy and
bounded by the actual configured chassis. Raw forbidden holes and dock bodies
never permit overlap with the complete swept chassis. Their planner clearance
margins are not applied a second time to a complete chassis.

The shared verifier checks a constant outgoing Twist, including the entire
reference-point path and chassis sweep. Convex endpoint hulls padded by an
angular arc-to-chord bound enclose intermediate body positions. Analytic
circular-path intersections split axle arcs at polygon supporting lines;
every resulting interval is classified against the raw allowed union. Straight
paths split at polygon crossings, using exact binary-rational predicates for
ambiguous determinants and fractions. Strictly disjoint edge bounding boxes
and certified interval exclusions skip irrelevant edges without discarding
possible crossings. The point-on-boundary tolerance is 1e-8 m; it is not
localization uncertainty or permission to cross an obstacle.

Snapshots validate frame, marker purpose, topology, finite coordinates and
footprints before use. Limits are 512 markers, 32768 total points, absolute map
coordinates at most 1e6 m, and a finite 3-64-vertex chassis of radius at most
3 m. Content defines snapshot identity independently of cached publication
stamps. Empty or invalid snapshots revoke these consumers' permission. This
identity is not a producer epoch, edit sequence, map datum or action lease.

FTC's common final output gate caps and checks every nonzero return: nominal
tracking, deviation, reverse, turn fallback and rotation. It obtains a fresh
map-frame robot pose and the costmap's configured footprint. PRE/PIVOT/POST
states also validate the complete remaining directed rotation using the same
wrapped heading error as the controller. Each translational command verifies
0.1 s of intended execution, corresponding to the shipped 10 Hz controller.
The interval is not a final actuator lease or a guarantee against downstream
command retention. Zero commands bypass all geometry and pose prerequisites.
Raster costs can further reject commands; free or soft-cost cells cannot grant
polygon permission.

Escape consumes one existing fresh arming token, verifies blade-off feedback,
and moves opposite the validated last direction. Defaults remain 0.10 m/s,
0.40 m and 6 s; compiled ceilings remain 0.15 m/s, 0.60 m and 15 s. It validates
the complete straight configured envelope before starting, then checks current
geometry identity/generation, fresh pose, remaining sweep, measured/commanded
distance, 0.05 m lateral drift, 0.15 rad yaw drift and absolute monotonic timeout
every tick. A tick gap above 0.5 s ends the attempt. Each outgoing command also
certifies 2.5 s of intended held translation and tapers to remaining distance /
2.5 s. Full-speed budget accounting can end the nudge short of the configured
maximum. Recovery efficacy and firmware deadband behavior need further
integration and hardware evidence. Halt and rejection publish zero.

`motion_footprint` is an internal behavior-node parameter derived by both full
launch builders from the existing `chassis_footprint` helper, including its
existing 0.05 m navigation clearance. An ad-hoc node without the derived
footprint cannot perform Escape. No operator YAML setting is added. Existing
firmware emergency stop, blade/localization guards and collision processing
remain in their existing paths.

Map replacement revokes before fallible live mutation. Invalid reloads clear
partial replacement state and publish empty authorization; correcting the file
and reloading restores normal permission. A missing file before mutation
preserves unchanged live geometry. Rings, counts and indexed records are
validated strictly. All valid persisted and parameter holes are retained,
including coincident-centroid and duplicate rings. Orphan obstacle-array
entries reject startup; omitted trailing entries still mean no holes. Invalid
add-area requests reject without altering the live map.

## Motion-path acceptance matrix

| Producer / path | Command path and authorization in this slice | Evidence / remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| FTC swaths, connectors, headlands, deviations | `computeVelocityCommands` common final gate -> Nav2 `/cmd_vel_nav` | 26 command cases, including original 12 negative and 4 positive controls; passed on the final production source |
| FTC PRE/PIVOT/POST and fallback reverse | Directed full rotation and final Twist sweep; existing costmap collision checks retained | Real-controller wheel-lag turn scenarios and complete footprint tests; passed on the final production source |
| EscapeStartBlocked | Bound action instance -> `/cmd_vel_nav`; geometry, pose, blade, arming and budgets; rejection/halt zero | 17 production-path DDS/command cases; passed on the final production source |
| Map permission production | #905-compatible `/map_server_node/transit_geometry`; `area.text=mowing|navigation`; revocation before replacement | 28 reload/add/parameter cases; passed on the final production source |
| Nav2 RPP/RotationShim transit and HOME | BT `NavigateToPose` -> Nav2 -> `/cmd_vel_nav` | No new execution gate. #905 protects planning, not controller corner cutting. OPEN |

| Dock and dock calibration | `/dock_robot` and independent docking commands -> `/cmd_vel_docking` -> mux | No new execution gate; non-default approach/undock distances and charge/resume mission unverified. OPEN |
| Motion heading seed / yaw / IMU / magnetometer calibration | Independent publishers, including `SeedYawFromMotion` -> `/cmd_vel_teleop` | Sharing the teleop lane does not make an autonomous calibration manual. OPEN |
| Dig recovery | `hardware_bridge_node::dig_monitor_tick` -> `send_cmd_vel_packet`, bypassing ROS mux | Existing limits retained; no geometry execution gate. OPEN |
| Selection, shaping, final motor packets | Collision monitor -> twist_mux -> bridge slew/deadband shaping -> firmware; bridge also has direct sources | FTC/Escape validate their intended source commands. No owner/action/revision lease after shaping or final-output integration evidence. OPEN |

## Verification record

Original regression baseline was reproduced on exact dev plus unchanged #942
sources in a separate non-root ROS build: 12 FTC negative cases and the one
Escape negative case failed; four positive FTC controls passed.

Final-source navigation, behavior and map builds passed all **80 CTest targets**
(22 + 46 + 12), containing **966 GoogleTest cases** (263 + 484 + 219).
The focused suites contain 26 FTC command cases, 18 continuous
sweep cases, 17 Escape cases and 28 map reload/add/parameter cases. All original
13 negative cases now pass and all four original positive FTC controls remain
green. Additional positive checks include real-FTC edge progress, 1000 legal
straight sweeps, 1000 curved headland sweeps around a hole, complete pivots,
connected polygon seams, and valid omitted trailing parameter entries.

The real FTC wheel-response fixture passed **100/100 scenario executions**:
20 repeats each of hedge U-turn recovery, fallback-disabled U-turn abort,
straight-wall abort, obstacle-during-recovery abort and no-LiDAR turn completion.
Each repeat contains two completions and three expected safe aborts, rather
than five completed missions. All executions report zero fixture lethal
samples. The unchanged dev/#942 baseline also passed all 100 executions of
those same existing fixtures. This establishes preserved fixture outcomes;
it does not measure full mission coverage or final actuator containment.

Fast DDS was used for the complete native suites. The four focused suites
(FTC, sweeps, Escape and map reload) additionally passed through CycloneDDS:
4/4 CTest targets containing the same 89 cases.

Host latency measurements below used production `26926295` and test-only
instrumentation `37af533e`. The dense-circle straight case previously averaged
226.411 ms before the certified edge exclusions, exceeding the shipped 100 ms
controller period. That comparison is to the prior implementation on the same
fixture, not an unmodified dev verifier: dev has no equivalent swept-geometry
verifier. No timing assertion is used to hide host scheduler variation.

| Geometry check | Samples | Mean | Largest observed check |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 32768-point circle, straight | 100 | 0.280 ms | 0.440 ms |
| Same circle, near-straight (`omega=1e-12`) | 100 | 3.85 ms | 5.17 ms |
| Same circle, curved (`omega=0.2`) | 100 | 0.845 ms | 1.393 ms |
| 32768-point rectangle, interior | 100 | 0.284 ms | 0.547 ms |
| Same rectangle, legal edge overhang | 100 | 0.225 ms | 0.350 ms |
| Complete 2-pi pivot with 49 holes | 3 | 10.45 ms | Not separately instrumented |

Repeated full-controller fixture means ranged from 0.033 ms (no-LiDAR overlay)
to 3.41 ms; the largest observed tick was 48.75 ms. These include existing
controller/costmap work. They are container/x86 host observations, not ARM
deadline guarantees or whole-stack CPU/memory overhead measurements. Across
20 runs, whole five-scenario GTest durations averaged 2280.9 ms on baseline and
2596.15 ms on the implementation. This includes setup/teardown and scheduler
variation; it is not isolated verifier CPU overhead or per-tick latency.

One additional paired process probe used `os.wait4` to obtain resource usage
for each actual test PID, avoiding inherited shell child-accounting. The five
controller scenarios passed again: baseline CPU user+system 2.441 s, peak RSS
58.6 MiB; implementation 2.959 s, peak RSS 60.1 MiB. The geometry-only 18-case
process passed with 0.824 s CPU and 32.2 MiB peak RSS. These single-process
samples include fixtures/frameworks, are sensitive to scheduling, and do not
isolate verifier overhead or predict a deployed stack's memory consumption.

Configuration/launch/URDF checks: **253 passed**, including both real full-system
launch builders with non-default chassis dimensions. These use lightweight
ROS launch adapters and execute the production builder code; they do not start
Nav2 or Webots. Firmware's 24 generated interface headers were checked, and Go
and TypeScript consumers regenerated with no drift in Linux under `LC_ALL=C`.
The additional existing OpenMower launch checks passed **11/11**. Repaired
sensor workflow YAML and all five explicit build dependency lists were checked.
Clean sensor CI at `0f66cd8c` passed GNSS (11 actual GoogleTest cases and
9 Python cases) and OpenMower (78 actual GoogleTest cases and 11 Python cases),
including newly generated interfaces and installed-consumer builds. OpenMower
amd64 and arm64 image builds and smoke tests also passed. The CI counter that
greps every XML `tests` attribute counts nested attributes twice; the case
counts here use GTest's actual executed-case output. The [full ROS workspace
Build & Test job](https://github.com/mowglinext/mowglinext/actions/runs/38010152519/job/114088099001)
also passed at `0f66cd8c`: 14 source packages built and tested, with colcon
reporting 3105 tests, 0 errors, 0 failures and 369 skipped. That colcon total
includes framework/linter results and is not an additional GoogleTest count.
Despite the job's historical `ROS2 kilted` name, its actual setup is Lyrical.

Native builds use Docker image `be2f6e79c62e`, Ubuntu 26.04, ROS Lyrical,
`/opt/lyrical_vendor` and UID/GID 1000:1000. Generated message interfaces are
unchanged; source packages and added shared headers are rebuilt separately
against the image's cached generated-interface prefix. Full clean workspace,
coverage-planner package and physical hardware builds are not established by
those local focused checks. The separate CI workspace build covers the source
ROS packages, including coverage; it does not build firmware or prove Webots
missions or physical behavior. Local logs live in `.validation/`, excluded from Git.
Fresh final `mowgli_interfaces` CMake configuration also passed, finding
visualization_msgs and Boost 1.90.0. This validates configuration/export wiring,
not a new generated-message compilation or a clean installed-consumer build.

Independent Sol review found and prompted fixes for inward-arc rejection,
failed-reload revocation, unwrapped remaining rotation, shallow crossings,
malformed rings, count/index omissions, orphan parameter holes and unnecessary
exact arithmetic. Each has dedicated regressions. The final source review of
`26926295` found no remaining confirmed source blocker or should-fix in this
scoped FTC/Escape implementation. Its runtime conditions were checked by the
final native, transformed-seam, dense-polygon and repeated-controller runs.
The reviewer explicitly retained the full-#924 and hardware acceptance gaps.

## Simulation and resource limitations

No Webots mission was executed. The repository's existing simulation recipe
was investigated, including LiDAR and no-LiDAR E2E harnesses. A reasonable
isolated setup attempt copied Webots R2025a and compatible scratch GLU/sndio
libraries from the shared Kilted container into the owned Lyrical container.
Loader probing still found missing `libasound.so.2`; Xvfb and Lyrical
`webots_ros2`/control packages are absent. Fetching the Dockerfile-pinned driver
revision failed before checkout. The shared simulator was not modified or
used for implementation missions.

Host C: fell to 141 MB free, causing compiler write I/O failure and Docker
Desktop failure. The user authorized recovery; Docker was restarted and
interrupted shared development/Signal Ledger services were restored. Deleting
only the owned redundant 454 MB Webots transfer cache recovered space for
serial focused builds. The app remains staged in the owned container. A full
current simulation image needs multiple GiB of backing storage and could not
be built safely within the remaining roughly 0.5 GB on C:. A subsequent isolated
recovery attempt uses a fresh D: scratch directory and separate bridge-networked
container (UID 1000, ROS domain 170, no robot devices or published ports). Its
pinned public driver source fetch succeeded; runtime dependencies were extracted
there. Non-root Xvfb/Qt startup succeeded and Webots printed `R2025a` with a
normal exit. The pinned driver is compiling against Lyrical. The tested current
Nav2, behavior and map package installations and unchanged generated interfaces
were separately staged on D: for overlay verification. Compatible driver and
current-stack integration are still being checked. App startup does not count
as a Webots mission or current-stack motion evidence.

Available controller fixtures execute the real FTC with modeled wheel response
and simulated endpoints. They can establish command progress, expected aborts
and fixture collision checks. They do not constitute full mowing, connected
area, dock/undock/HOME/charging-resume missions or post-mux hardware-output tests.
Mission completion, coverage percentage, final-command boundary violations and
whole-stack CPU/memory overhead therefore remain unmeasured.

The existing [OpenMower software hardware simulation](https://github.com/mowglinext/mowglinext/actions/runs/38010148929)
did execute on `0f66cd8c`: **178/179 checks passed** on its first attempt.
The failing `xesc_2040` 350 ms process-starvation scenario measured 0.224 m/s
instead of the unchanged 0.300 +/- 0.050 m/s progress requirement. Odometry
agreement, plausibility and board latch checks in that scenario passed. The
bridge/emulator/scenario sources are unchanged against the dev baseline; this
does not by itself explain the timing failure. The unchanged second attempt
passed **179/179 board/ESC checks and 10/10 stack seam checks**, with both
starvation scenes observing 0.299 m/s. The first unexplained miss is retained
as a repeatability limitation; no test, assertion or source was changed.
The preceding [dev simulation run](https://github.com/mowglinext/mowglinext/actions/runs/37965865987)
at `5733a399` passed 179/179 board/ESC checks and 10/10 stack seam checks;
the inspected bridge, simulation, hardware, message-schema and seam-launch
sources match this work's `9f39497f` dev baseline. It observed 0.300 and
0.299 m/s in the two starvation scenes. Its runner/runtime are separate evidence,
not an identical-host controlled comparison or an explanation of this failure.
The subsequent mux/bridge stack-integration script did not execute on the
first attempt because the board script returned failure. On the second attempt,
the real launch/mux/bridge moved emulated wheels through its teleop input and
stopped them after input release (970 ms observed, unchanged 1700 ms bound).
This emulates the OpenMower board/controllers
and charging/e-stop behavior; it is neither a Webots mowing mission nor evidence
for the FTC/Escape final-output invariant. No assertion was weakened.

## Unresolved safety and functionality acceptance

- Explicit producer epoch, revision and datum are absent. A map-server restart
  can leave cached permission, and depth-one DDS history can coalesce a
  revoke/restore transition. Escape generations cancel a delivered revoke,
  including restoration of identical content, but cannot detect an omitted one.
- FTC has no motion-owner/action lease. Source cancellation and geometry checks
  do not establish cancellation of a held, shaped or reselected downstream
  command. The final bridge may alter linear/angular proportions.
- Existing runtime obstacle-promotion centroid deduplication can report success
  while discarding a distinct candidate polygon. Pending-ID acceptance retains
  its polygon. This preexisting deferred gap prevents claiming protection of
  every successfully promoted forbidden region.
- Transit, docking, undocking, HOME, ingress, calibration and dig still require
  coherent bounded exceptions and final command authorization. Their normal
  missions have not been demonstrated on this implementation.
- Worst-case union construction, many intersecting rings and target ARM
  controller deadlines remain unmeasured. Host microbenchmarks cannot certify
  real-time hardware behavior.

## Physical acceptance

**HARDWARE_REQUIRED.** Record this branch's final ROS commit/image, firmware
image/hash, GNSS submodule/driver/receiver revisions, robot unit and configuration
hashes before running. No robot motion, firmware flash or physical deployment
was performed.

Remove blades, establish an exclusion zone, verify emergency stop, and use a
supervised low-speed fixture. Exercise repeated legal edge passes, pivots,
holes, blocked-start escape, connected transit, non-default dock/undock,
HOME/charge/resume and geometry revocation. Pass only if approved operations
progress and measured chassis motion stays within the declared geometry and
operation envelope. Rejected motion must stop within a separately measured
physical bound, with no blade/localization/emergency regression. Software
constant-Twist tests cannot establish slip, physical stopping distance, blade
safety or hardware reliability. Completing the open software paths is a
prerequisite to accepting the full #924 invariant.
