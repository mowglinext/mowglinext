# Mowing Session Monitoring

> How to record and read the JSONL session timeline. Loaded on demand from [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

**Whenever a mowing test is run (COMMAND_START, undock, autonomous motion, or any tuning session that involves the robot moving), also run the session monitor in parallel.** Output is a JSONL timeline that can be diffed/plotted across sessions to see how tuning changes affect behavior.

```bash
# Detached background from the host (writes to /ros2_ws/logs/mow_sessions/
# inside the container, which is not mounted — better to bind-mount docker/logs/
# or redirect via --output-dir):
docker exec -d mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py \
    --session 2026-04-29-fusion-graph-tuning-v1 \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'

# Interactively from inside the container (Ctrl-C to stop + write summary):
docker exec -it mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py --session <name> \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'
```

The `--output-dir /ros2_ws/maps` redirects to the bind-mounted `install_mowgli_maps` Docker volume so logs persist outside the container. Or bind-mount `docker/logs/mow_sessions/` explicitly in compose for a host-visible path.

**What it records** (per-sample, 10 Hz default):
- Fused pose + twist from `/odometry/filtered_map` (x/y/z, yaw, vx/vy/wz) **+ position covariance (cov_xx, cov_yy, derived sigma_xy_m)**
- TF snapshots: `map→base_footprint` (composed through `map→odom→base_footprint`), `odom→base_footprint` (local EKF)
- Wheel twist + covariance + integrated distance and yaw
- IMU gyro + accel + integrated gyro yaw
- GPS NavSatFix (lat/lon/alt/status/covariance) + `/gps/absolute_pose` ENU
- Dock heading (`/gnss/heading` while charging)
- BT state (state_name, current_area, current_strip), hardware mode, emergency flags, battery
- `cmd_vel_nav` (Nav2 output) + `cmd_vel` (post-safety, what reaches motors)
- Nav2 `/plan` length, next pose, goal pose, distance-to-goal
- LiDAR scan health (valid point count, min range)
- Fusion graph stats: pulled from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics` (node count, scan-match success rate, loop closures, marginal cov)
- **Cross-source consistency**: `fusion ↔ gps` distance, `wheel ↔ gyro` yaw drift, and `fusion ↔ scan-match` ICP success rate from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics`
- **RTK covariance-drop health**: on every RTK-Fixed GPS arrival, confirm `/odometry/filtered_map` cov drops to σ≤~3 cm within 300 ms — surfaced as `cross_checks.rtk_cov_check.{arrivals,ok,violations}` per sample and rolled into a `rtk_cov_check.verdict` ("healthy" / "intermittent" / "gate_rejecting" / "no_rtk") in the summary.

**Metadata header** (first line of the JSONL): session name, UTC timestamp, git branch + commit + dirty flag, docker image tags from `.env`, SHA-256 truncated hashes of `mowgli_robot.yaml`, `fusion_graph.yaml`, and the Nav2 params (`nav2_params_base.yaml` + `nav2_params_lidar.yaml` + `nav2_params_no_lidar.yaml`) — so sessions from different tunings are grouped/comparable.

**Summary record** (last line, written on Ctrl-C or clean shutdown): total duration, samples written, wheel-integrated distance, straight-line displacement, peak `fusion↔gps` error, peak `wheel↔gyro` yaw drift, RTK cov-check totals + verdict, final BT state.

**Log directory:** `docker/logs/mow_sessions/<session_name>.jsonl`. Commit notable sessions (golden runs, failure cases) so they survive in git history.
