# MowgliNext

Open-source autonomous robot mower monorepo. ROS2 Kilted, Nav2, robot_localization (dual EKF: local wheel+gyro, global +GPS, under `two_d_mode`) — with an opt-in GTSAM iSAM2 factor-graph localizer (`fusion_graph`, in `ros2/src/fusion_graph/`) that 1-for-1 replaces `ekf_map_node` when `use_fusion_graph:=true` and adds optional LiDAR scan-matching + loop-closure factors. BehaviorTree.CPP v4, opennav_coverage (Fields2Cover) for boustrophedon strip planning, MPPI for coverage path following. (`docs/HANDOFF_FUSION_GRAPH.md` is historical — kept around as the migration record but **not** the steady-state reference; see [`wiki/Architecture.md`](https://github.com/cedbossneo/mowglinext/wiki/Architecture#optional-factor-graph-localizer-fusion_graph) for current behaviour.)

## Safety — READ FIRST

This robot has spinning blades. The STM32 firmware is the sole blade safety authority.

- NEVER bypass firmware blade safety checks from ROS2
- Blade commands from ROS2 are fire-and-forget — firmware decides whether to execute
- Emergency stop is handled by firmware, not software
- Flag ANY change that could affect physical behavior as safety-critical in PR reviews

## Architecture Invariants (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **Localizer is in transition: robot_localization (dual EKF) by default, fusion_graph (GTSAM) opt-in.** `ekf_odom_node` always runs and publishes `odom → base_footprint` (wheel twist + IMU gyro_z under `two_d_mode`, tight `vy≈0` covariance enforces non-holonomic motion). For the map frame, two backends exist:
    - **Default (`use_fusion_graph:=false`)**: `ekf_map_node` fuses wheel + IMU + `/gps/pose_cov` (`pose0`, from `navsat_to_absolute_pose_node` with datum from `mowgli_robot.yaml` and lever-arm correction) + `/imu/cog_heading` (GPS course-over-ground yaw, `cog_to_imu.py`) + `/imu/mag_yaw` (when calibrated) and publishes `map → odom`. RTK-Fixed σ ~3 mm flows through as-is.
    - **Opt-in (`use_fusion_graph:=true`, see `ros2/src/fusion_graph/`)**: a GTSAM iSAM2 factor-graph node replaces `ekf_map_node` 1-for-1 — same inputs, same outputs (`map → odom` TF + `/odometry/filtered_map`), Pose2 graph at 10 Hz with custom `GnssLeverArmFactor` (analytic Jacobian), wheel between-factor with non-holo covariance, gyro between-factor on yaw, COG/mag yaw unary factors. **LiDAR scan-matching between-factors and loop-closure factors are wired** and gated by `use_scan_matching` / `use_loop_closure`; they let the map-frame estimate ride through multi-minute RTK-Float windows. Adds `/fusion_graph/diagnostics` (1 Hz `DiagnosticArray` with `total_nodes / loop_closures / scan_matches_ok|fail / cov_xx|yy|yawyaw`), `/fusion_graph/markers` (transient_local viz), `/imu/fg_yaw` (yaw-only output), and the services `~/save_graph` + `~/clear_graph` (both `std_srvs/Trigger`, surfaced in the GUI's Diagnostics → Fusion Graph panel).

   **slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, and FusionCore are gone.** The previous RTK-fallback architecture (parallel TF tree, `slam_pose_anchor_node` EWMA, `wheel_odom_tf_node`, `slam_scan_frame_relay`, `slam_map_persist_node`, `rtk_pose_mux_node`, fusion as `pose1`), the K-ICP encoder adapter, and the FusionCore 22D UKF were all removed in favor of the factor-graph approach. `fusion_graph` is the only LiDAR-aware localizer; the `kinematic_icp` and `fusioncore` submodules are no longer part of the build.
2. **TF chain follows REP-105** — `map → odom → base_footprint → base_link → sensors`. `map→odom` is published by `ekf_map_node` and `odom→base_footprint` by `ekf_odom_node`. All Nav2 nodes use `base_footprint` as the robot frame. `base_link` is at the rear wheel axis (OpenMower convention, do not move).
3. **Cyclone DDS** — not FastRTPS (stale shm issues on ARM)
4. **Map frame = GPS frame** — X=east, Y=north, no rotation transform
5. **Costmap obstacles disabled in coverage mode** — collision_monitor handles real-time avoidance
6. **dock_pose lives in `mowgli_robot.yaml`** — single source of truth for `dock_pose_x/y/yaw`. `calibrate_imu_yaw_node`'s dock pre-phase and `/map_server_node/set_docking_point` (called by the GUI to manually pin the dock to the current robot pose) both write back to `mowgli_robot.yaml` via line-splice updates that preserve comments. `hardware_bridge`, `map_server`, and `dock_yaw_to_set_pose` read the values as ROS parameters. There is no `dock_calibration.yaml` anymore.
7. **opennav_coverage (Fields2Cover) for multi-area boustrophedon coverage** — for each unmowed area, BT calls `/compute_coverage_path` which returns the full Path (headland inset, swaths, transitions) in one shot. BT nodes: `GetNextUnmowedArea` (outer loop), `ComputeCoveragePath` (one F2C call per area), `FollowCoveragePath` (single FollowPath goal driving headland + swaths + transitions, blade ON throughout). No per-strip inner loop. F2C `headland_mode.width = 0.80 m` insets strips from polygon perimeter to absorb F2C `min_turning_radius=0.30 m` U-turn arc apex + ~0.30 m MPPI overshoot at strip ends. F2C polygon holes come from **only** user-defined static obstacles + the small `dock_planning_polygon` (NOT auto-tracked obstacles — see invariant 14). Progress is painted along the *driven* track (TF-sampled at every BT tick) into `mow_progress`, NOT along the planned path — otherwise an MPPI shortcut to the last pose would mark the area 100% covered without driving any strip. Coverage status via `~/get_coverage_status` service and `/map_server_node/coverage_cells` OccupancyGrid topic.
8. **MPPI for coverage paths, RPP for transit** — coverage uses `nav2_rotation_shim_controller` wrapping `nav2_mppi_controller` (`FollowCoveragePath` plugin name in nav2_params). MPPI deviates around dynamic obstacles natively via `ObstaclesCritic`; FTCController is gone, and RPP would only stop-on-obstacle (not deviate) so it's wrong for coverage. Critical MPPI tunings (validated against the GHANSHYAM-13/coverage-path-planning public config — the only public MPPI+opennav_coverage example we found):
   - **PathAlignCritic** is the strip-lock primitive: `cost_weight: 15`, `cost_power: 2` (squared), `use_path_orientations: true`. Adjacent boustrophedon strips have OPPOSITE orientations, so `use_path_orientations` makes strip-jumping infeasible at the cost-function level. This is the right way to keep MPPI on its strip during local obstacle deviations — NOT tightening `max_robot_pose_search_dist` (which is along-path arclength, not Euclidean).
   - **`vx_min: -0.15`** to allow Reeds-Shepp reverse legs at strip-end U-turns. F2C's `min_turning_radius=0.30 m` + 0.18 m strip spacing forces a C\|C maneuver (forward arc + reverse arc); `vx_min >= 0` blocks the reverse leg and MPPI carves through the U-turn at higher omega, overshooting laterally. Trade-off: small reverse range exposes a cost-function local-min at strip ends where MPPI creeps backward instead of progressing — see task #39.
   - **`prune_distance: 2.0`**: longer values cause MPPI shortcut from start to path's last pose. With 50 (legacy default) MPPI ignored all 300 m of strip and drove straight to the NE corner.
   - **`CostCritic.consider_footprint: false`**: our local costmap has `inflation_radius=0.20 m` but chassis circumscribed_radius is 0.60 m. With `consider_footprint=true` the SE2-collision-checking path emits 6000+ errors per run (`computeCircumscribedCost` warning) and slows planning enough to break the controller patience timer. ObstaclesCritic still does the hard footprint collision check; CostCritic just handles the soft-cost gradient as a point.
   - Goal-checker: `xy_goal_tolerance: 0.20 m, stateful: false` (was 0.5 m / true — that latched SUCCESS on first brush of the last F2C pose, faking coverage).
9. **Emergency auto-reset on dock** — When emergency is active and robot is on dock (charging detected), BT auto-sends `ResetEmergency` to firmware. Firmware is sole safety authority and only clears latch if physical trigger is no longer asserted.
10. **Undock via Nav2 BackUp behavior** — BackUp (1.5m, 0.15 m/s) via `behavior_server`, not `opennav_docking` UndockRobot (isDocked() unreliable with GPS drift near the dock). Costmaps are cleared after undock.
11. **Zero-odom only when charging AND idle** — `hardware_bridge_node` does not reset odometry during undock sequence.
12. **Battery current for dock detection** — Hardware bridge publishes `abs(charging_current)` when charging, `0.0` when not, for `SimpleChargingDock` compatibility.
13. **Docking server cmd_vel** — Remapped to `/cmd_vel_docking` through twist_mux (priority 15).
14. **Coverage grid_map → OccupancyGrid convention** — easy to get wrong. `grid_map::GridMap::getSize()(0)` = cells along X, `getSize()(1)` = cells along Y. grid_map iterates with `r=0 → X_max` (decreasing) and `c=0 → Y_max` (decreasing). `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` has `width = X_cells`, `height = Y_cells`, row-major with `data[y_row * width + x_col]`, where `col=0 ↔ origin.x` (X_min) and `row=0 ↔ origin.y` (Y_min). To convert a grid_map cell `(r, c)` to an OccupancyGrid index: `og_col = nx - 1 - r`, `og_row = ny - 1 - c`, `flat_idx = og_row * nx + og_col`. ALWAYS set `mask.info.width = nx` and `mask.info.height = ny` — swapping produces a 90°-rotated mask, which silently marks valid interior polygon cells as lethal and breaks Smac planning with "Start occupied" errors. See `mow_progress_to_occupancy_grid()` in `map_server_node.cpp` as the reference implementation.
15. **`obstacle_tracker_node` is detection/viz only — NOT a planning input.** The tracker clusters costmap LETHAL cells into persistent shapes for visualization and a future operator-promotion flow ("user marks this as a permanent obstacle to plan around"). Its `ObstacleArray` is **deliberately not** consumed by the F2C polygon-hole list nor by the keepout mask. Real-time avoidance of dynamic obstacles is handled entirely by Nav2's `obstacle_layer` (which sees `/scan` directly) feeding MPPI's `ObstaclesCritic`. That pipeline is independent of the tracker, doesn't need persistence to work, and doesn't change the F2C plan. The tracker DOES still write its state to `obstacle_polygons_` so a future GUI flow can offer "promote tracked → static" — but the tracker on its own has zero planning authority. Reason this matters: in clean sim runs, transient ground-noise clusters that crossed the persistence threshold were silently entering F2C as polygon holes, F2C re-routed every replan, and MPPI ended up driving the robot past the polygon boundary at strip endpoints. Auto-promoting tracker output into planning was the source of multiple bug classes; cutting that pipeline is the correct architecture.
16. **Dock pose at the polygon border, not interior.** The recording flow has the user drive the lawn perimeter such that the dock straddles a polygon edge (typically with the dock's body half inside / half outside the polygon, and the approach corridor entirely outside). With `dock_yaw=4.17` (faces SSW), polygons should extend NNE of the dock so the robot's approach direction goes INTO the lawn. `dock_exclusion_polygon` (full ~1.95 × 0.8 m corridor) is used for keepout + classification; `dock_planning_polygon` (small ~0.55 × 0.8 m, dock structure only) is sent to F2C as a hole when the corners fall inside the polygon. With dock at the border, the planning hole's vertices typically straddle the polygon edge and the hole filter rejects it — F2C plans a clean rectangle with 0 holes. Putting the dock at the polygon interior forces F2C's BOUSTROPHEDON decomposition to cut strips around it, producing complex headland transitions MPPI's local view can't follow gracefully (the orbital trap of sim runs #3-#7).

2. BT enters `RecordArea` node — records position at 2 Hz, publishes live preview on `~/recording_trajectory`
3. User drives robot along boundary
4. GUI sends `COMMAND_RECORD_FINISH` (5) — trajectory is simplified (Douglas-Peucker) and saved via `/map_server_node/add_area`
5. Or GUI sends `COMMAND_RECORD_CANCEL` (6) — trajectory discarded

### Manual Mowing
- Dedicated BT state with `COMMAND_MANUAL_MOW` (7) — does not hijack recording mode
- Teleop via `/cmd_vel_teleop` (twist_mux priority)
- Blade managed by GUI (fire-and-forget to firmware)
- Collision_monitor, GPS, and the active map-frame localizer all remain active

## ROS2 Specifics

- **Distro:** Kilted
- **DDS:** Cyclone DDS (all containers share `docker/config/cyclonedds.xml`)
- **Topics:** Mowgli-specific topics under `/mowgli/` namespace
- **Frames:** `map` (global, GPS-anchored via fixed datum), `odom` (continuous local, dead-reckoning only — never jumps), `base_footprint` (robot frame for Nav2), `base_link` (rear axle), `lidar_link`, `imu_link`
- **TF chain:** `map→odom` (`ekf_map_node`, 30 Hz — absorbs GPS corrections), `odom→base_footprint` (`ekf_odom_node`, 50 Hz — continuous dead-reckoning), `base_footprint→base_link` (static), `base_link→sensors` (static — `base_link→imu_link` rotation = `imu_yaw/pitch/roll` from `mowgli_robot.yaml`, auto-calibratable via GUI button)
- **Units:** SI throughout (metres, radians, seconds)
- **Sensor fusion:** robot_localization dual EKF under `two_d_mode`. `ekf_odom_node` (25 Hz, wheel + gyro_z, publishes `odom→base_footprint`), `ekf_map_node` (10 Hz, wheel + gyro + `/gps/pose_cov` (`pose0`) + `/imu/cog_heading` + `/imu/mag_yaw`, publishes `map→odom`). Config in `ros2/src/mowgli_bringup/config/robot_localization.yaml`. Non-holonomic motion enforced by tight `vy` covariance in `/wheel_odom`. Absolute yaw for the map-frame EKF comes from `cog_to_imu.py` (GPS course-over-ground gated on forward motion) and `mag_yaw_publisher.py` (tilt-compensated magnetometer yaw, when magnetometer is calibrated). The `hardware_bridge_node` runs a 20 s IMU bias calibration (`imu_cal_samples: 1000`) every time the robot docks, and logs the implied mounting pitch/roll so the operator can promote any >1° offset into `mowgli_robot.yaml` → `imu_pitch/imu_roll`.
- **Navigation:** RPP for transit (FollowPath plugin in nav2_params); MPPI wrapped in RotationShim for coverage strips (FollowCoveragePath plugin). FTCController is gone; the cell-based strip planner that used to feed it is gone too.
- **Coverage:** opennav_coverage (Fields2Cover) plans the full per-area path (headland + swaths + transitions) in one F2C call. BT loop: `GetNextUnmowedArea` (outer) → `ComputeCoveragePath` (one F2C call) → `FollowCoveragePath` (single MPPI FollowPath goal driving the whole path with blade ON). Progress is painted along the **driven** track (TF-sampled per BT tick) into `mow_progress`, NOT along the planned path — otherwise MPPI's tendency to shortcut to the path's last pose lets the goal-checker fire SUCCESS without traversing any strip. Persistent obstacles from `obstacle_tracker_node` enter F2C as polygon holes (filtered by area, distance from boundary, and a 16-hole cap to avoid F2C 1.2.1 hangs). All areas mowed sequentially, then robot docks.
- **Area Recording:** `RecordArea` BT node records trajectory at 2 Hz, Douglas-Peucker simplification, saves polygon via `/map_server_node/add_area`. Live preview on `~/recording_trajectory`.
- **Manual Mowing:** Dedicated BT state (COMMAND_MANUAL_MOW=7). Teleop via `/cmd_vel_teleop`, blade managed by GUI. Collision_monitor, GPS, robot_localization remain active.
- **Emergency Auto-Reset:** BT auto-resets emergency when robot placed on dock (charging detected). Firmware is safety authority.
- **GPS fusion:** `navsat_to_absolute_pose_node` reads `/gps/fix` (NavSatFix) and emits `/gps/pose_cov` (PoseWithCovarianceStamped in `map` frame) with covariance derived from `position_accuracy` and a lever-arm correction applied via the current EKF yaw. `ekf_map_node` fuses `/gps/pose_cov` as `pose0`. `/gps/absolute_pose` remains exposed for the GUI and BT. With RTK-Fixed (σ ~3 mm) and frequent updates, the EKF converges to fix precision without special-case outlier gating.
- **fusion_graph (opt-in replacement for `ekf_map_node`):** Set `use_fusion_graph:=true` on `navigation.launch.py` (or persistently in `mowgli_robot.yaml`, exposed in the GUI's *Settings → Localization* section) to replace `ekf_map_node` with `fusion_graph_node` (GTSAM iSAM2). Pose2 graph at 10 Hz; one node per `node_period_s`, with a wheel between-factor (non-holonomic σ_y << σ_x), a gyro between-factor on yaw, a custom `GnssLeverArmFactor` (analytic Jacobian — antenna lever-arm rotates with the node's yaw, so it couples to heading correctly), and unary yaw factors for COG and tilt-compensated mag. **LiDAR scan-matching between-factors and loop-closure factors are wired** (gated by `use_scan_matching` / `use_loop_closure`) — they let the map-frame estimate carry through multi-minute RTK-Float windows, which is why this design exists. Reads datum + lever-arm from `mowgli_robot.yaml` via `fusion_graph.launch.py`. Persists `<graph_save_prefix>.{graph,scans,meta}` (default `/ros2_ws/maps/fusion_graph.*`); auto-saves on RECORDING→IDLE, dock arrival, and every `periodic_save_period_s` (5 min) in AUTONOMOUS state. Surface: `/fusion_graph/diagnostics`, `/fusion_graph/markers`, `/imu/fg_yaw`, services `~/save_graph` + `~/clear_graph` (both `Trigger`).
- **IMU mounting calibration:** `base_link→imu_link` rotation (imu_roll, imu_pitch, imu_yaw in mowgli_robot.yaml) is critical — if wrong, gravity-removal leaks into pitch and yaw integration degrades. Use the GUI's "Auto-calibrate" button next to IMU Yaw — the robot drives itself ~0.6 m forward then back and solves `imu_yaw = atan2(-ay_chip, ax_chip)` from accel direction vs wheel-derived `a_body`.
- **Nav2 tuning:** Global costmap 30m x 30m rolling window; keepout_filter disabled in global costmap (blocks transit/docking); collision_monitor PolygonStop min_points=8, PolygonSlow min_points=6; source_timeout 5.0s (ARM TF jitter); progress checker 0.15m required movement, 30s timeout; failure_tolerance 1.0; speeds: mowing 0.3/0.15 m/s, transit 0.2 m/s, max 0.3 m/s.
- **Joystick:** Foxglove client passes `schemaName` in `clientAdvertise` for JSON-to-CDR conversion. GUI shows joystick during "RECORDING" state (not just "AREA_RECORDING").

See sections below for detailed package descriptions, topics, and architecture.

## Git Workflow

**NEVER commit directly to main.** Always use feature branches and PRs:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/my-feature    # or fix/, refactor/, test/, chore/, docs/
# ... make changes ...
git add <files> && git commit -m "feat: description"
gh pr create --title "feat: my feature" --body "..."
```

### Dev Branch Workflow

Docker builds trigger on both `main` and `dev` branches. Images are tagged `:main` and `:dev` respectively. Use `mowgli-dev` / `mowgli-main` commands to switch between environments. Iterate on `dev`, merge to `main` when stable.

## Quick Commands

All ROS2 commands assume you are inside the devcontainer.

```bash
# Build ROS2 workspace
cd ros2 && make build

# Build a single package
cd ros2 && make build-pkg PKG=mowgli_behavior

# Run headless simulation
cd ros2 && make sim

# Run E2E tests (simulation must be running in another terminal)
cd ros2 && make e2e-test

# Format C++ code
cd ros2 && make format

# Run unit tests
cd ros2 && make test

# Build firmware
cd firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode && pio run

# GUI development
cd gui && go build -o openmower-gui && cd web && yarn dev

# --- Code generation (run after changing .msg/.srv files) ---

# Regenerate firmware rosserial C++ headers from ROS2 .msg files
python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py          # writes to firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode/src/ros/ros_lib/mower_msgs/
python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py --check   # diff-only, no writes (CI)

# Regenerate Go message/service structs from ROS2 .msg/.srv files
cd gui && ./generate_go_msgs.sh                    # writes to gui/pkg/msgs/*/types_generated.go

# Regenerate TypeScript ROS types (snake_case fields matching rosbridge JSON)
cd gui && ./generate_ts_types.sh                   # writes to gui/web/src/types/ros.ts
```

### Code Generation Workflow

When you modify `ros2/src/mowgli_interfaces/msg/*.msg` or `srv/*.srv`:
1. **Firmware headers:** `python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py` — regenerates rosserial C++ headers
2. **Go types:** `cd gui && ./generate_go_msgs.sh` — regenerates Go structs with JSON tags for rosbridge
3. **TypeScript types:** `cd gui && ./generate_ts_types.sh` — regenerates `gui/web/src/types/ros.ts` with snake_case fields matching rosbridge JSON
4. **Protocol constants:** Update `HL_MODE_*` defines in `firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode/include/mowgli_protocol.h` AND `ros2/src/mowgli_hardware/firmware/mowgli_protocol.h` (these are manually maintained — keep in sync with `HighLevelStatus.msg`)

Do NOT hand-edit `*_generated.go`, `ros_lib/mower_msgs/*.h`, or `gui/web/src/types/ros.ts` — re-run the scripts instead.

## Mowing Session Monitoring

**Whenever a mowing test is run (COMMAND_START, undock, autonomous motion, or any tuning session that involves the robot moving), also run the session monitor in parallel.** Output is a JSONL timeline that can be diffed/plotted across sessions to see how tuning changes affect behavior.

```bash
# Detached background from the host (writes to /ros2_ws/logs/mow_sessions/
# inside the container, which is not mounted — better to bind-mount docker/logs/
# or redirect via --output-dir):
docker exec -d mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py \
    --session 2026-04-29-fusion-graph-tuning-v1 \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'

# Interactively from inside the container (Ctrl-C to stop + write summary):
docker exec -it mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py --session <name> \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'
```

The `--output-dir /ros2_ws/maps` redirects to the bind-mounted `install_mowgli_maps` Docker volume so logs persist outside the container. Or bind-mount `docker/logs/mow_sessions/` explicitly in compose for a host-visible path.

**What it records** (per-sample, 10 Hz default):
- Fused pose + twist from `/odometry/filtered_map` (x/y/z, yaw, vx/vy/wz) **+ position covariance (cov_xx, cov_yy, derived sigma_xy_m)**
- TF snapshots: `map→base_footprint` (composed through `map→odom→base_footprint`), `odom→base_footprint` (local EKF)
- Wheel twist + covariance + integrated distance and yaw
- IMU gyro + accel + integrated gyro yaw
- GPS NavSatFix (lat/lon/alt/status/covariance) + `/gps/absolute_pose` ENU
- Dock heading (`/gnss/heading` while charging)
- BT state (state_name, current_area, current_strip), hardware mode, emergency flags, battery
- `cmd_vel_nav` (Nav2 output) + `cmd_vel` (post-safety, what reaches motors)
- Nav2 `/plan` length, next pose, goal pose, distance-to-goal
- LiDAR scan health (valid point count, min range)
- Fusion graph stats (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`): pulled from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics` (node count, scan-match success rate, loop closures, marginal cov)
- **Cross-source consistency**: `fusion ↔ gps` distance, `wheel ↔ gyro` yaw drift, and (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`) `fusion ↔ scan-match` ICP success rate from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics`
- **RTK covariance-drop health**: on every RTK-Fixed GPS arrival, confirm `/odometry/filtered_map` cov drops to σ≤~3 cm within 300 ms — surfaced as `cross_checks.rtk_cov_check.{arrivals,ok,violations}` per sample and rolled into a `rtk_cov_check.verdict` ("healthy" / "intermittent" / "gate_rejecting" / "no_rtk") in the summary.

**Metadata header** (first line of the JSONL): session name, UTC timestamp, git branch + commit + dirty flag, docker image tags from `.env`, SHA-256 truncated hashes of `mowgli_robot.yaml`, `robot_localization.yaml`, `nav2_params.yaml` — so sessions from different tunings are grouped/comparable.

**Summary record** (last line, written on Ctrl-C or clean shutdown): total duration, samples written, wheel-integrated distance, straight-line displacement, peak `fusion↔gps` error, peak `wheel↔gyro` yaw drift, RTK cov-check totals + verdict, final BT state.

**Log directory:** `docker/logs/mow_sessions/<session_name>.jsonl`. Commit notable sessions (golden runs, failure cases) so they survive in git history.

- `/ros2-engineering` — ROS2 node patterns, QoS, launch files, Nav2 (use for any ros2/ work)
- `/cpp-coding-standards` — C++ Core Guidelines (use for C++ reviews)
- `/docker-patterns` — Dockerfile and compose patterns (use for docker/ and sensors/ work)
- `/tdd` — Test-driven development (use when adding new features)

### Agents to Invoke
- **code-reviewer** — after any code changes
- **cpp-reviewer** — after C++ changes in ros2/
- **security-reviewer** — before commits touching auth, configs, or firmware commands
- **build-error-resolver** — when colcon or Docker builds fail
- **tdd-guide** — when implementing new features
- **architect** — for design decisions spanning multiple packages

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT add ROS1 patterns (rosserial, roscore, catkin) — this is ROS2 only
- Do NOT use FastRTPS — Cyclone DDS is required
- Do NOT mock the database/firmware in integration tests — use real interfaces
- Do NOT publish a `map→odom` TF from any node other than the active map-frame localizer. `map→odom` is owned by `ekf_map_node` (default) or `fusion_graph_node` (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`) — never both. The two are mutually exclusive in `navigation.launch.py`.
- Do NOT re-introduce slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, or FusionCore. All three were tried and removed: slam_toolbox required a parallel TF tree + EWMA anchor + gating that was fragile across RTK-Float windows; K-ICP only gave a body-frame twist with no absolute-pose information; FusionCore's 22D UKF would not collapse σ_xy below ~30 cm even under RTK-Fixed. The factor-graph design (`fusion_graph`) is the replacement — LiDAR enters the same graph as scan-matching between/loop-closure factors (see `wiki/Architecture.md` § *Optional: Factor-Graph Localizer*).
- Do NOT send blade commands without firmware safety checks
- Do NOT hardcode GPS coordinates, dock poses, or NTRIP credentials
- Do NOT switch coverage to RPP or FTCController — MPPI (wrapped in RotationShim, with `prune_distance ≤ 2.0`, `vx_min ≥ 0.10`, `PreferForwardCritic.weight ≥ 10`) is the chosen coverage controller. RPP and FTC were both tried and removed. MPPI used to "jump between swaths" only because of long `prune_distance` (50) and lax goal_checker (0.5 m, stateful) — both have since been tightened in nav2_params.yaml.
- Do NOT paint `mow_progress` from the planned coverage path — paint the driven track. MPPI shortcuts to the path's last pose under some conditions; if you paint the plan you get fake 100% coverage. `FollowCoveragePath::recordPose()` samples the actual TF map→base_footprint at every tick; that's what gets painted on SUCCESS.
- Do NOT use `base_link` as robot_base_frame in Nav2/robot_localization — use `base_footprint` (REP-105)
- Do NOT use opennav_docking UndockRobot — use Nav2 BackUp behavior (isDocked() unreliable with GPS drift)
